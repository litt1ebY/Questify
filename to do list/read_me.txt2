Task Management App - Python Project Presentation
Project Overview
This is a Gamified Task Management Application built with Python, designed to help users build productive habits through behavioral psychology principles including positive reinforcement and accountability mechanisms.
Core Features
1. Task Creation & Naming
The application provides an intuitive interface where users can create tasks with custom names, making it easy to organize and identify different responsibilities.
2. Frequency Management
Users can schedule tasks with multiple recurrence options:

Daily - For everyday habits (currently selected in the demo)
Weekly - For weekly commitments
Monthly - For periodic tasks
Specific Date - For one-time or custom-scheduled tasks

This flexibility accommodates various types of commitments from daily exercise to monthly reports.
3. Priority System
The app implements a sophisticated four-tier importance classification:

Low (Green leaf icon) - Nice-to-have tasks
Low (Fire icon) - Low priority tasks
Medium (Crown icon) - Moderate importance
High (Red crown icon) - Critical tasks

This visual hierarchy helps users focus on what matters most. The slider interface allows precise importance calibration, currently set to "Medium" difficulty.
4. Smart Notifications
Integrated reminder system with:

Customizable notification scheduling (shown: "Tomorrow, 5:00 PM")
Toggle on/off functionality for each task
Ensures users never miss important commitments

5. Gamification Engine
Reward System:

Users earn badges and points upon task completion
Provides positive reinforcement to build sustainable habits
Dollar sign icon suggests point-based achievement tracking
Addable rewards (red "+" button) for custom motivations

6. Accountability Framework
Punishment Mechanism:

Monetary punishment system (shown: $5 penalty)
Users can set custom punishments for incomplete tasks
Creates real consequences that drive completion
Fully customizable penalty amounts and types

7. User Interface Design

Clean, minimalist interface with warm color palette
Intuitive icon-based navigation
Back button for easy navigation
Delete options (trash icons) for flexible task management
Confirmation buttons (checkmarks) for commitment to penalties

Technical Implementation Benefits
This Python application demonstrates:

Frontend Development - Responsive UI with modern design principles
Database Integration - Task persistence and user data management
Notification Services - Scheduled reminder system
Gamification Algorithms - Point calculation and badge awarding logic
User Psychology - Behavior modification through rewards and consequences
Scalability - Modular architecture for feature expansion
